Scrappy MySQL Framework
=======

Scrappy was founded on the principle of consolidating development best practices and common data sources into a universal data set that can be leveraged for any application. It is designed to provide a base structure for developing back-end relational databases and systems. Scrappy is included with common lookup tables such as zip codes and helper functions that allow development teams to bootstrap new applications quickly and seamlessly.

The core principles of Scrappy are built upon industry best practices for scalability, security, and optimization. However, Scrappy is also designed to be customized and extended as needed.
